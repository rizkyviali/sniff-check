> Opinionated TypeScript/Next.js Development Toolkit

A comprehensive, high-performance Rust CLI tool that enforces opinionated code quality standards for TypeScript/Next.js projects. Built for speed, reliability, and developer productivity with advanced performance optimizations and comprehensive testing.

**üÜï NEW in v0.2.0: Component Analysis!** Smart component splitting analyzer for React/Vue/Angular components with complexity scoring and refactoring guidance.

[![Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/rizkyviali)

## üî• Core Philosophy

- **Files over 100 lines are considered "smelly code"** and should be refactored
- **TypeScript 'any' usage is forbidden** - strict typing enforced
- **Clean separation** between utilities and components
- **Zero-tolerance** for unused imports and dead code
- **Comprehensive pre-deployment validation**
- **Performance-first architecture** - optimized for large codebases

## ‚ö° Performance Features

- **Smart File Discovery** - Automatically excludes binary files, images, and build artifacts
- **Parallel Processing** - Multi-threaded analysis for projects with 20+ files
- **Memory-Mapped I/O** - Efficient handling of large files (1MB+) using memory mapping
- **Intelligent Caching** - Reduces redundant file system operations
- **Performance Monitoring** - Built-in timing and metrics (use `SNIFF_PERF_DEBUG=1`)
- **Optimized Regex Engine** - Shared pattern compilation for faster analysis

## üìñ Usage

### üéØ Most Common Commands

```bash
# üîç Find large files that need refactoring (>100 lines)
sniff large

# üß© Analyze and split large components (NEW in v0.2.0!)
sniff components

# üö´ Detect unused AND broken imports
sniff imports  

# üìù Check TypeScript code quality ('any' usage, type coverage)
sniff types

# üöÄ Complete pre-deployment validation
sniff deploy
```

### Interactive Menu
```bash
sniff
# or
sniff menu
```

Shows a beautiful terminal menu with all available commands.

### Core Commands

#### üîç Large Files Detection
```bash
sniff large
sniff --json large  # JSON output
sniff --quiet large # Quiet mode
```

Scans all TypeScript/JavaScript files and flags files over the threshold as "smelly code". Provides specific refactoring suggestions based on file type (component, service, API, etc.).

**Severity Levels:**
- **Warning** (100-200 lines): Needs attention
- **Error** (200-400 lines): Should be refactored
- **Critical** (400+ lines): Must be refactored immediately

#### üß© Component Analysis & Splitting
```bash
sniff components
sniff components --threshold 150  # Custom line threshold
```

Smart analysis of React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte components:
- **Complexity scoring** based on hooks, props, state, and nesting
- **Framework-specific detection** and recommendations
- **Extractable parts identification** (custom hooks, utility functions, sub-components)
- **Refactoring guidance** with specific splitting strategies
- **Multi-concern detection** for components handling too many responsibilities

**Analysis includes:**
- Hook usage patterns (useState, useEffect, custom hooks)
- Props complexity (too many props suggests multiple concerns)
- Component nesting depth and complexity
- Business logic that could be extracted
- UI elements that could become reusable components

#### üìù TypeScript Quality Check
```bash
sniff types
```

Comprehensive TypeScript analysis:
- Detects 'any' type usage (CRITICAL)
- Finds missing return type annotations
- Identifies @ts-ignore/@ts-expect-error comments
- Calculates type coverage score (0-100%)

#### üö´ Unused & Broken Imports Detection
```bash
sniff imports
```

Comprehensive analysis of import statements:
- **Unused Imports**: Detects unused default, named, and namespace imports
- **Broken Imports**: Identifies imports referencing non-existent files or uninstalled packages
- **Smart Suggestions**: Provides fix suggestions for broken imports (perfect for refactoring)
- **Refactoring Support**: Instantly spots issues after moving/renaming files
- Handles complex usage patterns (JSX components, type annotations)
- Shows potential bundle size savings
- Supports ES6, CommonJS, and dynamic imports

#### üì¶ Bundle Analysis
```bash
sniff bundle
```

Analyzes build output for optimization opportunities:
- Identifies largest chunks and files
- Calculates compression ratios
- Warns about oversized bundles (>2MB total, >500KB per chunk)
- Provides specific optimization recommendations

#### üöÄ Performance Auditing
```bash
sniff perf
```

Comprehensive performance analysis with Lighthouse integration:
- Runs Lighthouse audits on local development servers
- Checks Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Analyzes performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO
- Provides bundle size analysis and optimization recommendations
- Falls back to basic performance checks if Lighthouse unavailable

#### üß† Memory Leak Detection
```bash
sniff memory
```

Advanced memory leak pattern detection:
- Scans for common memory leak patterns in TypeScript/JavaScript
- Detects unremoved event listeners, timer leaks, circular references
- Monitors running Node.js processes for high memory usage
- Provides specific cleanup recommendations and best practices

#### üîß Environment Validation
```bash
sniff env
```

Complete environment variable validation:
- Checks required environment variables for TypeScript/Next.js projects
- Validates format for URLs, database connections, and Node environments
- Scans .env files for security issues and sensitive data exposure
- Provides environment health score and configuration recommendations

#### üèóÔ∏è Project Context Analysis
```bash
sniff context
```

Comprehensive project structure and context analysis:
- Analyzes project information (name, version, framework, languages)
- Maps directory structure and identifies file purposes
- Detects architectural patterns and organization quality
- Provides insights into project complexity and recommendations
- Supports multiple frameworks: Next.js, React, Vue, Angular, Svelte

#### üöÄ Pre-deployment Pipeline
```bash
sniff deploy
```

Comprehensive pre-deployment validation pipeline:
- Runs all quality checks in sequence (env, types, large files, imports, bundle)
- Provides deployment readiness assessment
- Shows detailed results for each check with timing information
- Fails fast on critical issues, allows warnings for non-blocking problems

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Management
```bash
sniff config init      # Initialize default configuration file
sniff config show      # Show current configuration
sniff config validate  # Validate configuration file
sniff config get types # Show configuration for specific command
```

### Output Formats

```bash
# JSON output for programmatic usage
sniff --json large

# Quiet mode for CI environments
sniff --quiet large

# Custom configuration
sniff --config custom.toml large

# Version information
sniff --version

# Help information
sniff --help
sniff large --help

# Performance debugging (shows detailed timing)
SNIFF_PERF_DEBUG=1 sniff large
```

### Performance Monitoring

Set `SNIFF_PERF_DEBUG=1` to see detailed performance breakdowns:

```bash
SNIFF_PERF_DEBUG=1 sniff large

# Output includes:
# --- Performance Report ---
# Total time: 285ms
#   File discovery: 283ms (Œî 283ms)
