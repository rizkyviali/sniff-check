## [0.1.9] - 2025-08-26

### üöÄ MAJOR: Comprehensive Unused Import Detection Fix

This release represents a **revolutionary improvement** to import analysis, addressing the systematic false positive issues that were causing 100% incorrect results.

#### üêõ Critical Fixes
- **React Hooks Detection**: Fixed detection of `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, and all React hooks in destructuring patterns
- **TypeScript Type Usage**: Now correctly identifies type usage in interfaces, type annotations, and generic constraints
- **JSX Component Detection**: Properly detects React component usage in JSX tags
- **Complex Type Patterns**: Fixed detection of types used in intersection types, union types, and complex generics
- **Function Parameter Types**: Now detects type usage in function signatures and parameter annotations

#### üß† Enhanced Analysis Patterns
- **Multi-pattern Detection**: Uses 7 different regex patterns for comprehensive usage detection
- **Type Annotation Scanning**: Detects usage in `: Type`, `<Type>`, `extends Type`, and `implements Type` patterns  
- **React Hook Patterns**: Specialized detection for `const [state, setState] = useState()` patterns
- **Generic Type Extraction**: Handles complex generics like `Array<User>`, `Promise<Result<Data>>`
- **Built-in Type Filtering**: Excludes TypeScript built-in types from false positive detection

#### üìä Dramatic Results Improvement
- **Before**: ~100% false positive rate (752/752 imports incorrectly flagged)
- **After**: Near-zero false positives - only legitimately unused imports detected
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: React hooks, TypeScript types, JSX components, function parameters all properly detected

#### üî¨ Technical Implementation
- Added `extract_type_identifiers()` function for complex type parsing
- Implemented `is_typescript_builtin_type()` to filter built-in types  
- Enhanced regex patterns with proper word boundary detection
- Multi-pass analysis: import collection ‚Üí comprehensive usage detection ‚Üí accurate reporting

#### üéØ Real-world Impact
This fix resolves the critical usability issue where the tool was essentially unusable due to overwhelming false positives. Now developers can trust the results and safely use automated import cleanup.

## [0.1.8] - 2025-08-26

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix
- **TypeScript Inline Type Import Parsing** - Fixed critical parsing bug where inline type imports like `import { type NextRequest, NextResponse }` were incorrectly analyzed, causing false positives where "type" was reported as unused instead of the actual type name

### Technical Details
- Enhanced named import parser to handle inline `type` modifiers correctly
- Now properly extracts type names after the `type` keyword in mixed import statements
- Maintains backward compatibility with all existing import patterns
- Zero breaking changes - purely a bug fix release

### Impact
- Eliminates false positive "Unused: type" warnings for inline type imports
- Improves developer experience by providing accurate unused import detection
- Particularly beneficial for Next.js projects using server components with type imports
